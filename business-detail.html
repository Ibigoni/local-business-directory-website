        <div class="comment-text">This has become my favorite coffee shop in the area. I have no good reason to choose a coffee selling chain on Calumet over this. The service is relatively quick, the baristas/owners are always very nice, and the coffee is great quality fosr a great price. </div>

        <div class="comment-text">I really wanted to love this place, but I just don't. Maybe I received 1 bad drink, or it was simply an off day for the barista. But whatever the case, both of my drinks were awful. My boyfriend is someone who always finishes what he buys, but even he wasnt up for it.</div>

        <div class="comment-text">I love having a local coffee shop to visit. The staff members are patient, courteous, and attentive.
        They have a well stocked storefront and a good area of chairs and seating.</div>
